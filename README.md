## CO*N*CEPT
![renders](http://users-phys.au.dk/jmd/github/concept/concept_renders.gif)

CO*N*CEPT (**CO**smological ***N***-body **C**od**E** in **P**y**T**hon)
is a free and open-source code for cosmological structure formation.
The code should run on any Linux system, though it is primarily intended
for massively parallel computer clusters with distributed memory.
The code is written almost exclusively in Python, but achieves C-like
performance thanks to Cython.

### Version 0.1.0
The 0.1.0 release corresponds to the version of the code used for the
[Î½CO*N*CEPT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03944).

### Quick installation instructions
As CO*N*CEPT has a lot of dependencies, it comes with an
[installation script](installer) which install all of these
(and CO*N*CEPT itself) into a single location.
The path to the CO*N*CEPT installation directory may be given
as an argument. If not, the installer will prompt you for a directory.
The installation will take a couple of hours depending on the hardware.
To speed up the installation you may supply the optional `--fast`
option which skips all tests (not recommended).
You can download and invoke the installer in one go by

    bash <(wget -O- --no-ch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmd-dk/concept/0.1.0/installer) [/path/to/concept] [--fast]

where brackets indicate optional arguments. Note that the `bash`
is required regardless of which shell you are using.


### Further documentation
Unfortunately, no up-to-date documentation exists.
An out-of-date [user guide](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07621) from back
when the code was particle-only,
as well as the [master's thesis](http://users-phys.au.dk/jmd/github/concept/masters_thesis.pdf)
for which CO*N*CEPT was originally written, are available.

CO*N*CEPT (**CO**smological ***N***-body **C**od**E** in **P**y**T**hon)
is a free and open-source cosmological structure formation code.
CO*N*CEPT should run on any Linux system, though it is primarily intended
for massively parallel computer clusters with distributed memory.
The code is written almost exclusively in Python, but it achieves C-like
performance thanks to Cython.

# Version 0.1.0
The 0.1.0 release corresponds to the version of the code used for the
[Î½CO*N*CEPT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03944).

# Quick installation instructions

# Further documentation
Unfortunately, no up-to-date documentation exists.
An out-of-date [user guide](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07621) from back when the code was particle-only,
as well as the [master's thesis](http://users-phys.au.dk/jmd/github/concept/masters_thesis.pdf) for which CO*N*CEPT was originally written,
are available.
